Pure functional programming rules

1. No state
2. Pure functions
    They dont depend on a global state
    Ur function should not depend on a global variable
3. No side effects
    Your function should not have any side effects outside of the function
4. High order functions
    A function is considered to be a high order function if one of these conditions are met
        1. The function takes one or more functions as parameters (callback example)
        2. The function returns another function as a result. (combinated pattern)
